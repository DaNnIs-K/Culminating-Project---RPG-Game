# Culminating-Project---RPG-Game

This game is a turn based and text based fighting game based off of games like pokemon and hades. 
You start off with 100 coins, and an option to enter a shop, to start a fight, or to leave the game. 
In the shop, you can buy weapons, armours, and usable items like health potions. 
After every fight, you get the option to continue or enter a shop again. 
Every time you beat an enemy, you get coins based on the difficulty of the enemy you killed and the next shop will have better items. 
Your goal is to survive for as long as possible.
